This repository contains the code and resources for Lab Work #6, which focuses on learning the basics of Flask, a lightweight and powerful Python web framework.
The project demonstrates the creation and interaction with an SQLite database and displays its contents on an HTML page using a GET request.

The main goal of this lab work is to:

1. Create an SQLite database to store sample data.
2. Use Flask to build a web server.
3. Fetch data from the SQLite database using a GET request.
4. Display the fetched data on an HTML page.
